# Introduction
### Scenario
Kickstarter, the crowdfunding platform, is thinking about providing a consulting service to 
project founders to help its customers create more successful crowdfunding campaigns. 

I’ve been asked to do some initial analysis and create a presentation that makes clear 
recommendations on how people can create a successful Kickstarter camp.

# Data Source
The dataset in this repository is scraped from early Kickstarter campaigns.

# Analysis Question
Which categories of Kickstarter projects have the highest success rates of being funded under 40 days?
